//TODO:

//rcs cost (and cost in general) => engine: 80% cost of a booster, complex big sat = ~50-70% of the total cost

//separtron?

// only a pilot can pilot a vessel (lv0 :can pilot, lv1: with prograde stability, lv2 :90Â°, lv3: all unlock, including target)
// only a scientist can use science instruments (kerbal-only instruments). 
// KIS: ony an ingenier can mount things together

// RT: remove antenna consumption from e/s to e/kio ( & add a real antenna to sphere or display the e/kio ) & display it in flight irt
//      remove "can be dammaged by high pressure" or use it


//NFS landing egs : better than landingLeg1 ?


//CIVIL sat mission (finish "time")
//Tourist mission


// icons

//upgrade stubs stats (tanks, solar, engiens, etc)
//payload bay: useful for pod ? (elec, rcs, lf) => upgrade in probe, size in size node?

main missions:
	
	
tech2


mun manned:
ST] flyby (unlock orbit node, or give sciecne to do so)
RE] orbit (science can be obtained via crew report)
RE] land (first land bonus)
RE] land with the munar mobile (more science!) => need to go to a checkkpoint

station:
ST] put a station in orbit
 - repair it (random failure 'contract', but always one)
 - crew it to do science with onboard exeriments
RE] put a modular station in orbit
 - add power panels
 - add science modules
RE(//)] eva missions:
 - rescue satelite
 - repair telescope
 - ?
RE(//)] long term studies experiment : need a kerbal for a long long time => at least 3 suply ship
	- has some contract (2?) who ask to suply it with some random useless module to atach to the long term study module (=> need at least 2 kerbal, because neeed always 1 inside)

probe:
ST] launch a probe to the mun, short-term science
RE] launch afleet of sat to the mun to have constant coverage -> unlock the long-term orbit studies
RE] launch to (minmus?,) duna, eve
RE(//)] launch a probe to the mun surface! (one-time  short-term science)
